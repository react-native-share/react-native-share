React Native Share, is a simple tool for sharing messages and files with other apps.

# Getting started ðŸš€

---

## Expo Managed Workflow

For Expo projects, you will need to be on a managed workflow and use the following command:

```shell
npx expo install react-native-share
```

Configure you `app.config.ts` or `app.json` to use the permissions needed by the library:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "react-native-share",
      {
        "ios": [
          "fb",
          "instagram",
          "twitter",
          "tiktoksharesdk",
        ],
        "android": [
          "com.facebook.katana",
          "com.instagram.android",
          "com.twitter.android",
          "com.zhiliaoapp.musically",
        ],
        "enableBase64ShareAndroid": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

`ios` parameter will take care of adding queries (LSApplicationQueriesSchemes) to the Info.plist.

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>fb</string>
  <string>instagram</string>
  <string>twitter</string>
  <string>tiktoksharesdk</string>
</array>
```

`android` parameter will take care of adding queries to the AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml
<queries>
  <package android:name="com.facebook.katana" />
  <package android:name="com.instagram.android" />
  <package android:name="com.twitter.android" />
  <package android:name="com.zhiliaoapp.musically" />
</queries>
```

`enableBase64ShareAndroid` will take care of adding the permission to the AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

And prebuild the project with `expo prebuild`.

## Bare React Native

If you are using `react-native >= 0.7X` and/or the new arch you just need to do a simple:

```shell
yarn add react-native-share
```

Or if are using npm:

```shell
npm i react-native-share --save
```

After that, we need to install the dependencies to use the project on iOS(you can skip this part if you are using this on Android).

Now run a simple: `npx pod-install` or `cd ios && pod install`. After that, you should be able to use the library on both Platforms, iOS and Android.

# Usage

Then simply import:

```js
import Share from 'react-native-share';

Share.open(options)
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    err && console.log(err);
  });
```

Which you do something similar to this:

# Documentation

If you are using a older version of `react-native` or `react-native-share`, having any problem or want to know how use `Share.open` and other functions, please refer to our new [docs](https://react-native-share.github.io/react-native-share) and help us improve that.ðŸš€
