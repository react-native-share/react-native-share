`react-native-share` uses [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for creating new releases. Also, we follow the [`commit-lint`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#readme) specification with [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky#readme) to handle our commit messages.

So whenever a new commit arrives at the `master`, if it's attending the `semantic-release` config to release a newer version in just a few minutes a new release will be published to npm. 🚀

## Example App

To run the example app, which is located at `./example`, just run a:

```shell
cd example && yarn && npx pod-install
```

By doing this, you will have a simple react-native project up and ready to go. Then, to since the last changes with the `../../` root folder, at the root folder run a:

```shell
yarn dev-sync
```

This command will copy the content from `iOS`, `android` and `index.js` to the `example/node_modules/react-native-share`.

If you have a better way to handle this, please fell free to open a PR pr a issue to help us with that. ❤️
