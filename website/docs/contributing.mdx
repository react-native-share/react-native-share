`react-native-share` uses [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for creating new releases. Also, we follow the [`commit-lint`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#readme) specification with [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky#readme) to handle our commit messages.

So whenever a new commit arrives at the `master`, if it's attending the `semantic-release` config to release a newer version in just a few minutes a new release will be published to npm. 🚀

## Using the Example App

To run the example app, which is located at `./example`, just run at the root project:

```shell
yarn && cd example/ios && pod install && cd -
```
And finally a `yarn start` at the root folder.

## Where is the package.json and node_modules?

We don't need a `package.json` or `node_modules` because we are using a custom config with `react-native.config.js`, that let us use easily the rootFolder of the project.

Also, we changed some native files like: [`AppDelegate.M`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-share/blob/56faa20d7ad30501056b89b24205f22c9efb93f3/example/ios/example/AppDelegate.m#L36), 
[`MainApplication.java`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-share/blob/56faa20d7ad30501056b89b24205f22c9efb93f3/example/android/app/src/main/java/com/example/MainApplication.java#L33) and
other files. By doing this, we are able to use the root-version of react-native-share and react at `../../../`.

If you want to do something similar on your library, or other project I recommend looking at [datetimepicker](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker) which was the base to apply this changes.
